WinKVM : Windows kernel-based Virtual Machine

* How to build WinKVM (English)
In this page will explain how to compile WinKVM.

You have to prepare three thing as follow:
1. Cygwin environment including gcc-3.x rsync, zlib and awk http://www.cygwin.com/
2. Visual Studio 2008 professional edition 
(You can use Microsoft Visual Studio Express instead of professional edition) 
http://www.microsoft.com/japan/msdn/vstudio/express/
3. Windows DDK: We use 3790.1830 version 
(The Microsoft® Windows Server™ 2003 Service Pack 1 (SP1) DDK) to develop WinKVM

You have to download and install these things.

Before building WinKVM driver, you have to set an environmental value that point to your 
Windows DDK installation path. Thus, you have to add BASEDIR2K3 environmental value 
(e.g. D:WINDDK3790.1830) to your Windows system. Visual Studio uses this environmental 
value at building WinKVM driver.

WinKVM building process is little confuse.
You have to build three things separately.
1. Building kvmctldll: Enter vcproj/user/kvmctldll and open kvmctldll.vcproj to build the 
kvm control library. After building kvmctldll, check vcproj/bin whether or not the building 
process was successful. If there is kvmctldll.dll in the directory, you succeeded.

2. Building original KVM drivers using Cygwin environment: 
cd kvm/kernel  ## Do not type configure
make           ## you will get id: unrecognised emulation mode: elf_i386 but it's not error
make cpobjs    ## If you get not a directory message, make it and try again

3. Open vcproj/kernel/winkvm.vcproj to build WinKVM driver. 
check vcproj/bin whether or not the building process was successful. 
If there is winkvmstab.sys in the directory, you succeeded.

4. Finally, You have to build QEMU using cygwin environment. Enter to kvm/winkvm-qemu
cd kvm/winkvm-qemu
./configure --prefix=path/to/installation --enable-kvm --target-list=i386-softmmu --disable-kqemu
make
make install

* How to use WinKVM (English)
Your operating system may be unstable after installing WinKVM 
because this software is alpha version.

Do not try to run on multi CPU system. If you want to it, you have to add the boot option to 
your Windows system to run with single-core mode.
To enable onecpu mode, type command on windows command prompt as follows:
cd c:\
attrib -h -r -s boot.ini
Now, you can see boot.ini in your c:\
Boot.ini is just a textfile so you have to add the textline as follows:
multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\WINDOWS="Microsoft Windows XP Professional (onecpumode)" /noexecute=optin /fastdetect /onecpu
Reboot your system and select "onecpumode".

First, Download the latest WinKVM binary file from http://github.com/ddk50/winkvm/downloads

Second, you have to WinKVM driver. Execute DIP_gui.exe attached to the binary archive to install 
winkvm driver. (Also, DIP_gui.exe is written by Mr.Kenji Akio. Thanks)

Third, Push the "..." button to select winkvmstab.sys driver and push the "Install" button to 
install the driver. Driver installation is required only one time. If you want to uninstall 
the driver, you can "..." button again and push the "Uninstall" button.

Finally, Now, you get ready to run WinKVM. Execute the batchfile that is named "WinKVM.bat" 
to execute WinKVM.

Have a fun!
